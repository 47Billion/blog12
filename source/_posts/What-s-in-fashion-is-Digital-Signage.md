Digital Signage is the contemporary marketing and promoting tool that gives your customer high brand awareness and customer engagement. In this hypercompetitive market it is vital to align with the changing trends to poise your brand to the desired level. The competition is not only with other physical outlets but with online retailers too. After a long dayâ€™s work a customer may only want to browse through the items he is looking for rather scraping shelves after shelves in your shop.  Another problem that he may face is on the available sizes, colors, and patterns. 

Why your estimated revenue does not match the final numbers:

Static display boards, signs are simply not attracting attention. 
Mannequins display a very limited number of available options.
Attributes like sizes, colors, patterns, variety is missing on the display showcase.
Customers sometimes find it difficult to locate what they are looking for.
Consumers are not aware of the new arrivals, offers, discounts, benefits or clearance sales.

With the help of Digital Signage you can turn the tides in your favor. Digital Signages provide following benefits:

      4) Way-finding application allows your customers to find correct shelf and the desired product.

      6) Videos of models walking the ramp wearing clothes that are available in the store provides high-fashion, trendy atmosphere.
      7) Vertically-placed, sleek displays with videos give high-brand look to the store.
      8) You can change promotion frequently and if required immediately for various products.
      9) You can sell advertising space to your suppliers.
     10) You can share testimonial videos, live feeds on fashion shows, play audio and display    texts.
     11) Provides next-generation digital identity and helps you to establish yourself as a world-class brand.

Studies say that people still visit physical outlets, maybe only to enquire on the product and order it later online. However, physical stores continue to be the  place where the most significant consumer and retailer value is created. Digital technology transforms your brick and mortar business into a hybrid of online and offline business bringing together best of the two. It allows you to engage your customers in new ways, once they walk into your door and increase your conversion rate. Engaging your customers around an enhanced audio and video environment of digital signages and interactive kiosks will ultimately add to your revenue numbers.
